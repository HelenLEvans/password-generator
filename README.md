# Password Generator

Challenge #3
This app allows a user to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. Prompts walk the user through the criteria; for example, the first prompt asks how many characters the user would like their new password to be. When the user has finished answering the prompts, the app generates a random password based on their choices.
